    "The *git pull* command is basically the combine of *git fetch* and *git merge* in one command, so that two branches are merged without reviewing. The downside is that *git conflict* can happen without reviewing the code prior merging. By default, *git pull* will update the current local branch from the origin main.  Therefore, it is a good practice to combine the use of *git checkout \"branch name\"* and *git pull \"branch name\"* to explicitly define the local branch to get the update and the remote branch to pull the update. \n",

Note that this is only necessary when your task requires the updated part of the origin main branch, for example, a function that is fixed by a team member that is required for your analytic work.  We can also achieve the same objective by using *git fetch origin* + *git rebase main* to pull updates from origin main to the local main, but the first option is a much cleaner solution, which most of the time is preferred.\n",

It points to the last commit which happened in the current checkout branch. It's treated as a pointer for any reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using *git reset*, we can work in hard, soft, and mixed modes.  Hard model is used to go to the pointed commit, the working directory gets populated with files of that commit, and the staging area gets reset. In soft reset, only the pointer is changed to the specified commit. The file of all the commits remain in the working directory and staging area before the reset. In mixed reset (default mode), the pointer and the staging area both get reset.\n",

Only use it if you are sure that all files and data are not relevant to the project.\n",

    "The *git revert* command is basically a new commit to the current working directory. However, it does not \"revert\" back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits. Two important advantages of *git revert* over *git reset* is that it doesn't change the project history, which makes it a \"safe\" operation for commits that have already been published to the shared repository.  Also, it is able to target an individual commit at an arbitrary point in the history, whereas *git reset* can only work backward from the current commit.  \n",

The goal of merging and rebasing is to take the commits from a development branch and put them on to a master branch or any other branch. The advantage of using *git rebase* instead of *git merge* is that *git merge* creates a more complex tree structure of the commit history, whereas *git rebase* allows us to move all the development branch commits on top of the main branch for a clean straight-line graph. It makes it easy to trace what commits went where. \n",
